      <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Coping up with world's technological advancement</h3>
<h4>The future and IT are both interconnected.</h4>
What finds it interesting for me is that our world is continuously getting futuristic and it is getting vast. I would want to make sure I always catch up, and so this made me start to believe learning all about Information Technology can help me get there.
<br>
<h3>Why choose RMIT?</h3>
<h4>It's not a question of why-- it Should Be RMIT.</h4>
Sure, there are a lot of other universities that can provide IT courses as well. But their realistic visions, motivating goals and the values they represent had got me into them. RMIT will prepare me for success (even if there are a lot of errors involving IT), exposes me with new ideas and equip me with skills and knowledge I have not acquired or can improve, and then excel into it so it can show me a proper path in my career. 
<br>
<h3>IT Expectations</h3>
<h4>Learning is not that easy, but can be eager for it.</h4>
Because of the course being online, there are some areas, specially hands-on ones, will be difficult to learn. However, that doesn't stop as someone like me whose motivated to pass this course. Being introduced to Information Technology, I'm keen to know more about how we can apply IT in our daily lives, its impact (both postive and negative), what are its advantages and disadvantages, and then learning how can I implement myself in contributing to one.

      <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
      <hr>
      <img src="JobSeeker.png" style="width:630px;height:867px;"><br>
      <h3>Multimedia Specialist is my ultimate ideal job to have.</h3>
<p>As a specialist in this area, you have to  create and manipulate the animation, audio, video and graphic from computers to multimedia programs. They are the ones responsible in  produce data and content for the physical disks found inside DVDs or game trays.</p>

<p>These can also be found in places such as multimedia presentations, mobile telephone resources,  information kiosks, websites, electronic gaming environments, e-commerce & e-security solutions, and entertainment & education products.</p>

<p>This position interests me so much because I am able to express my own creative designs without any limitations (though its possible I am given with a template), as well as being tasked to develop them without any hindrance from the a company's request.</p>

<p>The idea in this multimedia specialist is they combine the analyzation, design and development from software programming and scripting languages, which I am currently invested to learn to get experience of, then apply it, which made this very appealing for me.</p>

      <h2>The Results</h2><hr>
      <strong>What the results mean for me?</strong>
      <p>It means that I can be relatively unique since in the first test, it is considered to be rarest as an Advocate. One of the major factor for this is my combination of personality traits that makes them complex and quite versatile. Based on the other tests as well, my strengths comes passionately hard from creativity, imagination and sensitivity, which I truly believe I possess, that made it even better, as this will become useful for my ideal job in the future. However, I should note that I should be careful at times because being able to think in abstract doesn't mean I can use it in concretely real life.</p>
      <strong>Results influencing my behaviour in a team:</strong>
      <p>Being an advocate also signifies standing up for what is right, and thus impacts others to do the same thing. The results tell me I am able to uplift and helping others when facing hardships and so this will gain me a great positive influence on my team. On that note, my tests have told me there will be potential frustrations to people and myself if people, or in this case, my team doesn't appreciate my best intentions for them so I should take considerations to counter this. </p>   
      <strong>Taking the result into account when making a team:</strong>
      <p>When forming a team, I will take in account of my weaknesses, and my loopholes in my personalities so that any problems that surfaces will be negated by my member's strengths, and instead will make my team with a better cooperation. For example, it is said that my personality will most likely reluctant to open up, causing burden and dishonesty in the group but if my members are extroverts who lighten up the atmosphere, it will break my comfort zone and actually be able to avoid that weakness.</p>
